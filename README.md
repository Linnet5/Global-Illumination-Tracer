# Monte Carlo Ray-Tracer

This software is able to render images of 3D scenes in which light reflects between surfaces. It can handle spherical objects, as well as objects built out of triangular polygons. The software can also handle different surface materials that reflect the light differently. Monte Carlo ray tracing techniques are used to handle global illumination calculations.
